#Email API

**Overview**

The Email API is a RESTful web service developed using Spring Boot, which provides a simple and efficient way to send emails programmatically. This API allows developers to integrate email functionality into their applications seamlessly, enabling communication with users through email notifications, alerts, and messages.

**Features**
1) Send Email: The API supports sending emails with customizable content, including text, HTML, and attachments.

2) Template Support: Developers can define email templates for common use cases, such as account activation, password reset, or newsletter subscriptions, to streamline email composition and formatting.

3) Dynamic Content: Developers can inject dynamic data into email templates, such as user-specific information, using placeholders or template variables.

4) Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented to ensure reliable email delivery and provide feedback in case of failures or issues.

5) Security: The API incorporates security best practices, such as authentication and authorization, to prevent misuse and protect sensitive email content.

**Technologies Used**
* Spring Boot: Framework for building Java-based web applications, providing features like dependency injection, auto-configuration, and embedded web servers.
* Java: Programming language used for backend development.
* Spring MVC: Web framework for building RESTful web services and handling HTTP requests and responses.
* JavaMail API: Java library for sending and receiving email messages via SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 protocols.
* Thymeleaf: Java-based template engine for server-side rendering of HTML email templates.
* Spring Security: Framework for authentication, authorization, and protection against common security vulnerabilities. (*In progess)
